# Task for oracle

Advisory only: challenge and choose the safest cross-repo solution for the pre-existing Ocean Surface switch_session race between GET /v1/sessions/{id} hydration and /v1/agent/events. Inspect current /private/tmp/ocean-os-session-cursor-20260716 and /private/tmp/ocean-surface-tauri-integrate-20260716-v2. Evaluate daemon-issued cursor designs, atomicity with persistence/event emission, per-session lock options, replay eviction, permissions/components/tool ordering, and backwards compatibility. Reject client-only buffering if it cannot prove exactly-once projection. Return a concrete recommended contract, proof sketch, migration plan, and unresolved decisions. Do not modify files or launch subagents.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: reviewed
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Implement the requested change without widening scope
- criterion-2: Return evidence sufficient for an independent acceptance review

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, validation-output, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Review gate: required by reviewer.

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
