// Answers one question: does every events.md entry still close with its `___`
// rule? The union merge driver (.gitattributes) loses exactly one rule per
// extra parallel append — both sides end their entry with the SAME trailing
// rule the entry before them ends with, so xdiff anchors each insertion before
// that shared line and union emits both bodies with the one rule they share.
// The two entries then fuse: the second `time:` header lands directly under the
// first entry's prose. No conflict, no marker, nothing a merge check would see.
// So the loop runs this before and after every rebase and diffs the verdict.
//
// Ported from ocean-bedrock's scripts/check-ledger.mjs (its PR #62, commit
// 09bb1bb), by way of the identical ocean-os copy. Every executable line is
// byte-identical to bedrock's; only comments and the usage text differ, and the
// usage text only because it can name no npm script — this repo has no node
// manifest to hold one. Keeping the code itself identical is deliberate: a fix
// to any copy ports to the others as a patch.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS CHECK DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
//   Compare totals. Rule lines against entry count is a different question and
//   this ledger is the cleanest demonstration available that it lies: 269
//   entries against 258 rules, a shortfall of ELEVEN — and 22 entries are open,
//   because 11 other entries carry a second rule inside their prose. The two
//   errors cancel exactly, so the subtraction returns a plausible number that
//   is half the truth. Only "is THIS entry closed before the next one starts"
//   holds everywhere.
//   Match a fixed rule width. Every rule this ledger has written is 81
//   underscores and scripts/events-merge-driver.test.mjs builds its fixtures at
//   the same width, but the sibling repos use widths of their own; all of them
//   are the same rule, so the shape is what matters and never the length.
